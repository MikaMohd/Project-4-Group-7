                               ##Predicting Medical Expenses using Linear Regression
 #Problem Statement
We'll work through a typical machine learning problem step-by-step:

QUESTION: ACME Insurance Inc. offers affordable health insurance to thousands of customer all over the United States. As the lead data scientist at ACME, you're tasked with creating an automated system to estimate the annual medical expenditure for new customers, using information such as their age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits and region of residence.

Estimates from your system will be used to determine the annual insurance premium (amount paid every month) offered to the customer. Due to regulatory requirements, you must be able to explain why your system outputs a certain prediction.

A CSV file containing verified historical data, consisting of the aforementioned information and the actual medical charges incurred by over 1300 customers.
![Alt text](image.png)

The dataset contains 1338 rows and 7 columns. Each row of the dataset contains information about one customer.

Our objective is to find a way to estimate the value in the "charges" column using the values in the other columns. If we can do so for the historical data, then we should able to estimate charges for new customers too, simply by asking for information like their age, sex, BMI, no. of children, smoking habits and region.

Looks like "age", "children", "bmi" and "charges" are numbers, whereas "sex", "smoker" and "region" are strings. None of the columns contain any missing values, which saves us a fair bit of work!

The ranges of values in the numerical columns seem reasonable too, so we may not have to do much data cleaning or correction. The "charges" column seems to be significantly skewed however, as the median (50 percentile,it is also known as 2nd quartile) is much lower than the maximum value.


  #Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
Let's explore the data by visualizing the distribution of values in some columns of the dataset, and the relationships between "charges" and other columns.

We'll use libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly for visualization.


  #Age
Age is a numeric column. The minimum age in the dataset is 18 and the maximum age is 64. Thus, we can visualize the distribution of age using a histogram with 47 bins (one for each year) and a box plot. We'll use plotly to make the chart interactive, but you can create similar charts using Seaborn.

![Alt text](Age.png)

The distribution of ages in the dataset is almost uniform, with 20-30 customers at every age, except for the ages 18 and 19, which seem to have over twice as many customers as other ages.

Insight: why there are over twice as many customers with ages 18 and 19, compared to other ages?

Insuarance agency charges more money for same premium as you get older and here is the same case.people who are younger are less prone to getting sick and thus company has to pay them less for their medical bills.otherwise every age group in US has eqvivalent population density.

  #Body Mass Index
Let's look at the distribution of BMI (Body Mass Index) of customers, using a histogram and box plot.

![Alt text](BMI-1.png)

The measurements of body mass index seem to form a Gaussian distribution centered around the value 30, with a few outliers towards the right.

Insight:why the distribution of ages forms a uniform distribution while the distribution of BMIs forms a gaussian distribution?

As there are same number of people in age groups the distribution we get is uniform distribution.But, for BMIs distribution we get gaussian distribution as people who are between 20-3- are considered to be healthy relatively and less than or more than this range is considered to be health risk categories and these people are more prone to health issues and thus company will have to pay more medical bills of this kind of customers and thus they provide these type of people same health insuarance at higher prices and which in-turn attracts lesser people with out of healthy range BMI because they have to pay more.

  #Charges
Let's visualize the distribution of "charges" i.e. the annual medical charges for customers. This is the column we're trying to predict. Let's also use the categorical column "smoker" to distinguish the charges for smokers and non-smokers.

![Alt text](<Medical Charges-1.png>)

We can make the following observations from the above graph:

For most customers, the annual medical charges are under $10,000. Only a small fraction of customer have higher medical expenses, possibly due to accidents, major illnesses and genetic diseases. The distribution follows a "power law"
There is a significant difference in medical expenses between smokers and non-smokers. While the median for non-smokers is $7300, the median for smokers is close to \$35,000.

![Alt text](<Charges Gender.png>)

![Alt text](<Region Charges.png>)

Here in the distribution of charges over gender we see that males are substancially charged more because by subconsious behaviour males are exploratory and they are more likely to take risks and that keeps them in danger more than their counterpart.It is also evident that males of U.S are more inclined to get health insuarrance then female. And, in second distribution we see that southeaster part of U.S is leading in charges but majority of all customers from all parts of US are charged between 0-20k only.

  #Smoker
Let's visualize the distribution of the "smoker" column (containing values "yes" and "no") using a histogram.

![Alt text](Smokers.png)
It appears that 20% of customers have reported that they smoke.We can also see that smoking appears a more common habit among males. This is true for the given dataset only and so we should always verify if these results of analysis also matches the general population which we are going to use our model on otherwise the model will assume that in general population also 20 % people are smokers but in reality it was only 10 % so we would get incorrect predictions.So it is best to check if our primary data analysis matches the results of the general public.

 #Visualization of the distributions of the "sex", "region" and "children" columns.
 ![Alt text](<Children Charges.png>)

 It seems that majority of our customers have 0 or 1 child and median charges vary between 8.5k to 11k dollars
We can also conclude that people who have more children are given less priority in terms of pricing discounts.
Having looked at individual columns, we can now visualize the relationship between "charges" (the value we wish to predict) and other columns.

 #Age and Charges
Let's visualize the relationship between "age" and "charges" using a scatter plot. Each point in the scatter plot represents one customer. We'll also use values in the "smoker" column to color the points.

![Alt text](<Age Vs Charges.png>)

We can make the following observations from the above chart:

The general trend seems to be that medical charges increase with age, as we might expect. However, there is significant variation at every age, and it's clear that age alone cannot be used to accurately determine medical charges.
We can see three "clusters" of points, each of which seems to form a line with an increasing slope:

The first and the largest cluster consists primary of presumably "healthy non-smokers" who have relatively low medical charges compared to others

The second cluster contains a mix of smokers and non-smokers. It's possible that these are actually two distinct but overlapping clusters: "non-smokers with medical issues" and "smokers without major medical issues".

The final cluster consists exclusively of smokers, presumably smokers with major medical issues that are possibly related to or worsened by smoking.

Insight: What other inferences can we draw from the above chart?

even if you have ailment or not people who are smokers for majority of the cases incurred more charges in medical bills than non-smokers and this difference is not small it is in the range of 5000 to 1000 $

 #BMI and Charges
Let's visualize the relationship between BMI (body mass index) and charges using another scatter plot. Once again, we'll use the values from the "smoker" column to color the points.

![Alt text](<BMI Vs Charges.png>)
It appears that for non-smokers, an increase in BMI doesn't seem to be related to an increase in medical charges. However, medical charges seem to be significantly higher for smokers with a BMI greater than 30.

 #Visualizing how the "charges" column is related to other columns ("children", "sex", "region" and "smoker").

 ![Alt text](<Children Charges 2.png>)
 There doesn't seem to have a strong trend among this variables but we can see that customer having 5 children have charges incurred in a very specific range of 0 to 20,000$ and majority of customers having any number of children or no children altogether have charges in range of 0-20,000 dollars

 ![Alt text](<Sum Vs Sex.png>)
 We can infer that from every region our customer base which has males are incurring more bills but interestingly females of northwest region are having more medical bills why is this happening that needs more in dept research.

  #Correlation
As you can tell from the analysis, the values in some columns are more closely related to the values in "charges" compared to other columns. E.g. "age" and "charges" seem to grow together, whereas "bmi" and "charges" don't.

Here's how correlation coefficients can be interpreted

Strength: The greater the absolute value of the correlation coefficient, the stronger the relationship.

The extreme values of -1 and 1 indicate a perfectly linear relationship where a change in one variable is accompanied by a perfectly consistent change in the other. For these relationships, all of the data points fall on a line. In practice, you wonâ€™t see either type of perfect relationship.

A coefficient of zero represents no linear relationship. As one variable increases, there is no tendency in the other variable to either increase or decrease.

When the value is in-between 0 and +1/-1, there is a relationship, but the points donâ€™t all fall on a line. As r approaches -1 or 1, the strength of the relationship increases and the data points tend to fall closer to a line.

Direction: The sign of the correlation coefficient represents the direction of the relationship.

Positive coefficients indicate that when the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable also tends to increase. Positive relationships produce an upward slope on a scatterplot.

Negative coefficients represent cases when the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable tends to decrease. Negative relationships produce a downward slope.

 #Machine Learning
Every machine learning problem has three components:

1.Model

2.Cost Function

3.Optimizer

Linear Regression using Multiple Features
So far, we've used on the "age" feature to estimate "charges". Adding another feature like "bmi" is fairly straightforward. We simply assume the following relationship:

charges=w1Ã—age+w2Ã—bmi+b

![Alt text](<BMI Vs Charges-1.png>)

We can also visualize the relationship between all 3 variables "age", "bmi" and "charges" using a 3D scatter plot.

![Alt text](<Charges Vs BMI Vs Age.png>)

You can see that it's harder to interpret a 3D scatter plot compared to a 2D scatter plot. As we add more features, it becomes impossible to visualize all feature at once, which is why we use measures like correlation and loss.

This is an important thing to keep in mind: you can't find a relationship that doesn't exist, no matter what machine learning technique or optimization algorithm you apply.

As BMI has very less correlation with charges we get a higher loss on a model which predicts charges on the basis of BMI as a independent variable as seen above loss value is increased which is a degradtion in our model


![Alt text](<Children Vs Charges.png>)
we don't see a big reduction in the loss, even though it's greater than in the case of BMI.

![Alt text](<Age Vs Charges-1.png>)
Loss is very high compared to earlier. This is because it is easier to fit a line for model when it is grouped for non-smokers and there would be some outliers as shown in above viz.

 #Using Categorical Features for Machine Learning
So far we've been using only numeric columns, since we can only perform computations with numbers. If we could use categorical columns like "smoker", we can train a single model for the entire dataset.

To use the categorical columns, we simply need to convert them to numbers. There are three common techniques for doing this:

1.If a categorical column has just two categories (it's called a binary category), then we can replace their values with 0 and 1.
2.If a categorical column has more than 2 categories, we can perform one-hot encoding i.e. create a new column for each category with 1s and 0s.
3.If the categories have a natural order (e.g. cold, neutral, warm, hot), then they can be converted to numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4) preserving the order. These are called ordinals.

 #Binary Categories
The "smoker" category has just two values "yes" and "no". Let's create a new column "smoker_code" containing 0 for "no" and 1 for "yes".
